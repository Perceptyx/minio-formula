# **NOTE:** browser and drive_sync options will be ignored 
# They are keep here for informational purposes.
# Sadly "on" and "off" are intepreted as booleans by yaml 
# so "True" and "False" are the values that are rendered 
# in the /etc/default/minio file, and obviously minio just 
# refuses to start as it doesn't recognises that values.
